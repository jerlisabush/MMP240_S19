	<h1>Step 1!</h1>
	<p> Step 1, pick a finished anime thats under 100 episodes. I know it doesnt sound easy but in actuality it is. There are plenty of anime with various genres that have under 100 episodes. For example, if youre more into anime that is heavy in romance here is a list of some romance anime. There are also some anime that have recently hit the market that arent finished however, have a decent amount of episodes that arent too overwhelming. </p>
