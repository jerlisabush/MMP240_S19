<h1>Yusuke Urameshi</h1>
<p>Yusuke Urameshi is a fourteen-year-old delinquent who attends Sarayashiki Junior High School. His poor school attendance, constant fighting and bad habits have earned him the fear of his classmates and the disdain of his teachers and neighbors. This all changes rather abruptly when Yusuke is struck and killed by a car while saving a small child who has wandered into the road. Such an altruistic deed catches even the Underworld by surprise, and because they do not have a place for him yet in heaven or hell, he is permitted to return to his body and resume his life.[ch. 1] However, while doing so it is revealed that Yusuke has a particularly strong aura, or spirit energy, and Koenma recruits him as Underworld Detective. Yusuke is charged with investigating supernatural phenomena in the Human World that have connections to the Underworld. Yusuke bears affection for his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura, who initially takes a role as Yusuke's conscience, making sure he comes to class and behaves, and later becomes his romantic interest. Yusuke's alcoholic mother, Atsuko, raised him as a single parent after conceiving him as a young teen</p>

<h1>Kazuma Kuwabara</h1>
<p>Kazuma Kuwabara is a classmate of Yusuke's at Sarayashiki Junior High School. Despite his unusual affinity for kittens, he is the second toughest delinquent at the school, constantly picking fights with Yusuke to prove himself stronger, but never succeeding.[ch. 1] Eventually Kuwabara's feelings of anger toward Yusuke become feelings of respect. Although he loves fighting, Kuwabara would never steal or extort money.[ch. 17] Kuwabara has a very advanced sixth sense,[ch. 3] though not as acute as his older sister Shizuru's. Kuwabara ends up assisting in most of Yusuke's cases, having gained the ability to form a sword out of his own aura called the Aura Sword during the competition to become Genkai's pupil.[ch. 26] He learns to develop this power rather quickly; being able to wield two at once after training with Kurama for the Dark Tournament,[ch. 52, 53] and create a more powerful sword that boosts his recuperative abilities, acting as both a weapon and shield, by using the Sword of Trials he gets from Suzuki.[ch. 101] Kuwabara later obtains the Dimensional Sword during his fight against Kiyoshi Mitarai, a sleeker and cleaner aura sword that possesses the ability to slice and cut through and between dimensions</p>

<h1>Kurama</h1>
<p>Kurama is a Fox Demon (妖狐 Yōko) and former thief, who specialized in undoing seals and stealing ancient treasures.[ch. 21] Fifteen years before the series began, he was badly injured and escaped to the Human World in soul form, where he entered an embryo in a pregnant human woman, becoming Shuichi Minamino (南野 秀一 Minamino Shūichi) at birth.[ch. 21] Within ten or so years his powers would return and his body would become inhuman, at which point he planned to leave. However, Kurama comes to love his now-single human mother, and when she becomes gravely ill he cannot bear to leave her all alone, and remains as Shuichi in the Human World.[ch. 21] Having teamed up with Hiei and Goki to steal three Underworld treasures, Kurama becomes a target of Yusuke Urameshi. However, he betrays his partners and takes the Mirror of Darkness (暗黒鏡 Ankoku-Kyō, known as the "Forlorn Hope" in the English anime dub), a mirror capable of granting the user's desire at the cost of the user's life, to cure his mother of her deadly illness. Yusuke saves Kurama's life with both of them giving some of their lifeforce, therefore they both survive (in the anime, the mirror cancels the sacrifice due to Yusuke's kindness).[ch. 21] This act bonds Yusuke and Kurama as friends and allies.</p>

<h1>Hiei</h1>
<p>Hiei is introduced as one of three wanted demons, alongside Kurama and Goki, who stole three treasures from the Underworld. With the Conjuring Blade (降魔の剣 Kōma no Ken), a sword that turns anyone cut by it into a demon, he plans to create an army.[ch. 22] As the last of his partners on the run, Hiei kidnaps Keiko in an exchange with Yusuke for the other two treasures. However, he also cuts her with the Conjuring Blade, forcing Yusuke to defeat him to save her, which he does with help from Kurama and Botan.[ch. 23] Hiei possess the Evil Eye (邪眼 Jagan, referred to as the "Jagan Eye" in the English anime) implanted in his forehead, which gives him clairvoyance and allows him to control lesser demons and humans with only a glance.[ch. 22] He can transform into a form with Evil Eyes all over his body, boosting his powers. While assisting Yusuke in defeating The Four Beasts in exchange for a reduced sentence, Hiei changes and no longer acts solely for his own interest.[ch. 38] For associating with humans, Hiei and Kurama are invited to take part in the Dark Tournament on Yusuke and Kuwabara's team.[ch. 51] During the Dark Tournament he debuts the technique known as the Black Dragon Unholy Fire (邪王炎殺黒龍波 Jaō Ensatsu Kokuryūha, lit. "Tyrant King's Blaze-Murdering Black Dragon Wave", "Dragon of the Darkness Flame" in the English anime), which allows him to summon and control black flames from the Demon Plane.[ch. 57] He eventually masters the technique by consuming the flames, which greatly enhances the user's abilities</p>
