<h1>Yugi Muto</h1>
<p>One of the main protagonists of the story. He wears the Millennium Puzzle (千年パズル Sennen Pazuru), one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact holding the spirit of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. He fears the other personality inside him at first; however, as the narrative progresses, he grows a strong bond with his other self and considers his other soul a close and valuable friend. Several defining character moments for him was when he defeats antagonists without Dark Yugi's help in games under bleak circumstances, proving that he is truly worthy of being the Millennium Puzzle's wielder.</p>

<h1>Katsuya Jonouchi / Joey Wheeler</h1>
<p>Yugi's close friend. Jonouchi is loyal, heroic, good-natured, brave, funny, friendly, kind-hearted, and loving. When Ushio beats up Jonouchi and Honda, Yugi stands up for them, and it's then that Jonouchi realizes that he was jealous of Yugi's "treasure" all along. Later on that night, he retrieves the last Millennium Puzzle piece and brings it back to Yugi's house, where Yugi completes it and challenges Ushio to the first Shadow Game of the series. Jonouchi is touched by Yugi's behavior towards him and they become loyal friends, forming his own "treasure."
Jonouchi is good at fist fighting and is usually able to take on people bigger than him, such as Bandit Keith (in the second anime, this quality is underplayed). Though not exactly the best gamer in Domino, he develops a better liking to them thanks to Yugi, and he's managed to use his strong points to help Yugi come through in earlier story lines. Later on, he develops an interest in the Duel Monsters game, the latest fad at the time. Though unskilled at first, with Yugi's help, he trains for the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City tournaments for his sister; progressively getting better throughout the series to the point where he could be called a match for Dark Yugi. Jonouchi is shown to have a very kind heart, selfless and caring, considerate, and eager willingness to help and save those he deeply cares for and loves, but he also demonstrates a near lack of modesty and can be rather rash at times, making him a source of comic relief. He also has an extreme fear of ghosts, mummies, and anything else that could be considered 'creepy'. Jonouchi notes that, before he met Yugi, he was never really motivated for anything. As the story progressed, he learned to channel his anger into games instead of his fists.</p>

<h1>Anzu Mazaki / Téa Gardner</h1>
<p>Yugi's childhood best friend and an extremely supportive girl with a lot of spirit for her friends, who has a crush on Atem. Anzu is not an avid game-player and her ability is well below that of Yugi, though she exhibits some knowledge of video game RPGs during the Monster World arc. Her dueling ability is decent and she used to defeat Jonouchi in school before he became a seasoned duelist. She is athletic, has a strong school spirit, and secretly worked at a fast food restaurant called Burger World to save money; her secret dream is to attend a dancing school abroad in New York. When Yugi and Jonouchi find out about these secrets when they followed her (thinking she's taking part in Enjo kōsai), she gains a new respect for Jonouchi and her childhood friend, who are more than willing to support her dream and keep her secret.</p>

<h1>Hiroto Honda / Tristan Taylor</h1>
<p>Honda, who is in class 1-B at Domino High School, is a boy who became a friend of Yugi, Jonouchi, and Anzu. Later on, he becomes a friend to Bakura as well. In the manga, Honda starts out as Jonouchi's street thug buddy and also (at first) has a crush on Miho Nosaka. In the 1998 anime, he is the head of the school's beautician department. Along with Jonouchi, he was saved from the bully Ushio by Yugi, though he still dislikes Yugi at first. After admitting his love for Miho Nosaka to Jonouchi, he is convinced by him to ask Yugi for his help in writing a love letter to her in the form of a puzzle. When the vain teacher Ms. Chono confiscated the puzzle, threatening to punish Miho if the secret admirer doesn't come clean, Yugi and Jonouchi stood up for him by saying they were the ones who wrote it. Ms. Chono decides to put together the puzzle to find out who the sender is anyway, and Dark Yugi secretly turns it into a Shadow Game, shattering Ms. Chono's pretty face as the Penalty Game. From then on, Honda warms up to Yugi and becomes one of his dearest friends, despite the fact that Miho later turns him down when he asks her out directly.
In the English version of the Duel Monsters anime, his past was heavily edited, to remove the violent fighting bits, and his importance is slightly down-played. In the Duel Monsters anime, he has a large crush on Jonouchi's sister Shizuka and his origin story with Miho is never mentioned. He also has a strong rivalry in the English version with Duke Devlin and regularly competes with him for Serenity's affections.</p>

<h1>Seto Kaiba</h1>
<p>The current President and CEO of the Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba was first introduced as a prodigious, cold-hearted gamer who stopped at nothing to achieve his goals, even resorting to seemingly killing his opponents. He lived a bad childhood because of his good for nothing stepfather. When Kaiba learned that Yugi's grandfather possesses a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" card, he ends up dueling Yami Yugi and lost while ending up in a coma after Yami used his power to momentarily shatter Kaiba's heart to purge it of his evil. Though reformed, later learning his rival's identity to be Atem, Kaiba retains his arrogance and rivalry with Yugi. While Kaiba leaves the story following the Battle City arc, he appears in the anime adaption as a major character and has been mentioned in sequel Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series as the founder of Duel Academy. In the movie Dark Side of Dimensions and its prequel manga chapters, he is revealed to have developed Solid Vision. Kaiba attempted to bring back Atem to settle things between them, which causes much of the storyline to occur before he departed to the afterlife after Atem. Kaiba uses a Blue-Eyes deck and his ace monster is Blue-Eyes White Dragon.</p>
